With a staggering array of over 8,000 movies and TV shows accessible on their platform, as of mid-2021, their global subscriber count exceeds 200 million. This tabulated dataset comprehensively catalogues all offerings on Netflix, including vital details such as cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, and more.\n\n### Why this topic?\n\n-   Firstly, it provides a rich source of information about user preferences and viewing habits, which are essential for building accurate recommendation models.\n\n-   Secondly, the Netflix movies dataset enables the development and evaluation of advanced *recommendation algorithms* and *machine learning models*. With access to detailed information about movie genres, ratings, release years, crew and cast, and user interactions, etc. scientists can experiment with various algorithms such as [collaborative filtering]{.underline}, [content-based filtering]{.underline}, and [hybrid methods]{.underline} to improve the [accuracy]{style=\"color: red;\"} and [relevance]{style=\"color: red;\"} of recommendations.\n\nMoreover, by continually updating and expanding the dataset, we contribute to the ongoing research and development efforts in the field of recommendation systems. As streaming platforms like Netflix evolve and introduce new content, it becomes imperative to adapt recommendation algorithms to accommodate these changes and ensure that users receive personalized and engaging recommendations.\n\n## Dataset Overview\n\n### About\n\nThe Netflix Titles dataset is a comprehensive compilation of movies and TV shows available on Netflix, covering various aspects such as the title type, director, cast, country of production, release year, rating, duration, genres (listed in), and a brief description. This dataset is instrumental for analyzing trends in Netflix content, understanding genre popularity, and examining the distribution of content across different regions and time periods.\n\n### Key Details\n\n**Dataset**: [Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows)\n\n**Total Entries**: The dataset contains 8,809 entries, each representing a unique movie or TV show.\n\n**Columns**: There are 12 columns in the dataset:\n\n1)  **show_id**: A unique identifier for each title.\n\n2)  **type**: The category of the title, which is either 'Movie' or 'TV Show'.\n\n3)  **title**: The name of the movie or TV show.\n\n4)  **director**: The director(s) of the movie or TV show. (Contains null values for some entries, especially TV shows where this information might not be applicable.)\n\n5)  **cast**: The list of main actors/actresses in the title. (Some entries might not have this information.)\n\n6)  **country**: The country or countries where the movie or TV show was produced.\n\n7)  **date_added**: The date the title was added to Netflix.\n\n8)  **release_year**: The year the movie or TV show was originally released.\n\n9)  **rating**: The age rating of the title.\n\n10) **duration**: The duration of the title, in minutes for movies and seasons for TV shows.\n\n11) **listed_in**: The genres the title falls under.\n\n12) **description**: A brief summary of the title.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Frequently used functions and libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# get counts for any passed column\n\nget.count <- function(data, column) {\n  column <- enquo(column)  # Capture the column name\n  cnt <- data %>%\n    count(!!column)  # Unquote the column name\n  return(cnt)\n}\n\ncustom_colors <- c(\"Movie\" = \"#db0000\", \"TV Show\" = \"#564d4d\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Visual representation of dataset\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- read.csv(\"./files/netflix_titles.csv\")\ncolumns_to_delete <- grep(\"^X\", names(df))\n# Reason for deleting columns is that it makes additional columns after reading files. \n# Columns are called X, X.1, X.2 and so on.\ndf <- df[, -columns_to_delete]\nas_tibble(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8,809 × 12\n   show_id type    title   director cast  country date_added release_year rating\n   <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr>    <chr> <chr>   <chr>             <int> <chr> \n 1 s1      Movie   Dick J… \"Kirste… \"\"    \"Unite… September…         2020 PG-13 \n 2 s2      TV Show Blood … \"\"       \"Ama… \"South… September…         2021 TV-MA \n 3 s3      TV Show Gangla… \"Julien… \"Sam… \"\"      September…         2021 TV-MA \n 4 s4      TV Show Jailbi… \"\"       \"\"    \"\"      September…         2021 TV-MA \n 5 s5      TV Show Kota F… \"\"       \"May… \"India\" September…         2021 TV-MA \n 6 s6      TV Show Midnig… \"Mike F… \"Kat… \"\"      September…         2021 TV-MA \n 7 s7      Movie   My Lit… \"Robert… \"Van… \"\"      September…         2021 PG    \n 8 s8      Movie   Sankofa \"Haile … \"Kof… \"Unite… September…         1993 TV-MA \n 9 s9      TV Show The Gr… \"Andy D… \"Mel… \"Unite… September…         2021 TV-14 \n10 s10     Movie   The St… \"Theodo… \"Mel… \"Unite… September…         2021 PG-13 \n# ℹ 8,799 more rows\n# ℹ 3 more variables: duration <chr>, listed_in <chr>, description <chr>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Error checking\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n RMSE = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(\\hat y_i - y_i)^2} {n}}\n\\end{equation}\n$$ Here we can see how to calculate RMSE (Root Mean Square) which is either one of two closely related and frequently used measures of the differences between true or predicted values on the one hand and observed values or an estimator on the other.

However, there are countless more options for further investigation and study.\n\nOne area for future research could be the extraction and analysis of genres from the dataset. By categorizing movies and TV series based on genre, we may learn about audience preferences, trends over time, and how genre popularity varies across nations. Analyzing genre data in relation to criteria such as release year, production type (movies or series), and even audience ratings could reveal important insights into the entertainment industry's dynamics.\n\nFurthermore, we might investigate the dataset's temporal characteristics by evaluating trend lines over time. This could include studying how the number of movies and TV episodes released each year has varied over time, finding trends in genre popularity across different time periods, and looking for any links between release dates and things like viewer ratings or box office results.\n\nWe might also look deeper into the behavior of different sorts of content (movies vs. series) and how it relates to measures like viewer engagement, audience demographics, and streaming platform preferences. Understanding how audience preferences differ between movies and television shows could help streaming platforms and production businesses improve their content creation and marketing tactics.\n\nOverall, there are numerous potential directions for future analysis and exploration of this dataset, ranging from genre-based analyses to temporal trends and audience behavior. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques and visualization methods, we can uncover valuable insights into the dynamics of the entertainment industry and audience preferences.\n\n## Books\n\nOne of the popular books and well-written ones is [@Frey+2021]. The content is about *algorithmic recommender systems*, deployed by media companies to suggest content based on users’ viewing histories, have inspired hopes for personalized, curated media but also dire warnings of filter bubbles and media homogeneity. All these facts were introduced in @sec-intro.\n\n## Articles\n\n-   For more information about Netflix recommendations and recommender systems read [@inproceedings].\n\n-   Additional paper [@inbook]\n",
